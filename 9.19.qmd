```{r}
data("crimtab")
df <- data.frame(
  Height = as.numeric(colnames(crimtab)),
  Count = colSums(crimtab)
)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x = Height, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "yellow") +

    y = "Number of Individuals"
  )

```

This graph shows the heights of different criminals, and the shape of this graph is bell-shaped, indicating that it follows a normal distribution. which means that most individuals have heights near the average, while very short or very tall heights are less common.
